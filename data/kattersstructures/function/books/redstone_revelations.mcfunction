Gather \'round the campfire, for Belford Blockwright has a tale to tell. Not just any tale, mind you, but a chronicle of wonder, a saga of sparks and circuits – the history of redstone!"','"Now, you might think redstone has always been there, pulsing beneath our cobblestone streets. But no, friends, its story is far more fascinating. Legends whisper of a time before redstone, a time when our contraptions relied on brute force and elbow grease."','["We hoisted water with buckets, lit our homes with endless torches, and our farms were tended by weary hands alone.","\\nThen, one fateful day, a young miner named Jasper struck a vein unlike any other."]','"It wasn\'t coal, nor diamond, but a strange, glowing red dust. Curiosity sparked in Jasper\'s eyes – the same spark, some say, that flickered within the dust itself. He brought his find back to the village, and that\'s when the real tinkering began."','"At first, the redstone was a mystery. It pulsed with a faint light, but its purpose remained a puzzle. Then, a stroke of genius from our very own emerald-clad librarian, Esmeralda Everbright! She noticed the dust reacted strangely to touchstone.
