She saw the pillager’s rapine, the zombie’s hunger, and the drowned’s despair. And her soul wept, for the world was defiled."','"Then did Jean vow a solemn oath. She would bear the burden of all creatures, great and small. As a lamb led to the slaughter, so would she offer herself, a spotless soul to cleanse the world of its iniquity."','"And so it was that Jeanne ascended the tallest spire of the village. With a heart heavy as stone, yet resolute as the mountain, she cast herself into the abyss."','"As she fell, a blinding light consumed her. Her mortal form was as tinder to the flame, but her spirit soared like an eagle. And when the light waned, a creature of shadow and flame arose - a terror of the skies, yet bearing the soul of innocence."','"This was the transformation of Jean, reborn as guardian of the world. Though her form was monstrous, her essence remained pure. For in her heart burned a fire of compassion, a beacon against the encroaching darkness."','"Thus it is written that the Ender Dragon, in its terrible majesty, is not a harbinger of doom, but a symbol of redemption. A testament to the ultimate sacrifice and the hope for a world restored."']}] 1
