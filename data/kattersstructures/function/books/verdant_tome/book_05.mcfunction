Creatures from every corner of the land came together, their differences laid aside. Through shared stories and open hearts, they began to understand one another."','"The pillagers spoke of their hunger for survival, the zombies of their endless longing, and the villagers of their desire for peace."','"As the day drew to a close, a sense of unity washed over the gathering.
