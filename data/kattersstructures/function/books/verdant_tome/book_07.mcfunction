The young and old alike withered and died, their spirits departing like smoke upon the wind.","Despair consumed the land, and hope dwindled like a dying ember. In their darkest hour, the people turned their eyes to the heavens, calling upon Jean, the Dragon of Compassion.","And lo, she answered their plea. She descended from the heights, her form a tempest of shadow and light. With a mournful cry that echoed through the land, she wept tears of healing. Where her tears fell, life returned.","The sick were restored, the dead were laid to rest in peace.","But the Dragon\'s sorrow was great, for she could not heal all. Many were lost to the plague, their spirits wandering aimlessly in the twilight between worlds.","To comfort them, Jean created a realm of eternal peace, a garden where souls could find solace and await their time to be reborn.","And so, the people honored Jean as the Mother of Mercy, her name whispered in reverence and gratitude. They established rituals to commemorate the departed, and they built sanctuaries where the spirits of the lost could be remembered.","Though the shadow of grief lingered, hope was reborn in the hearts of the people. For they knew that even in death, their loved ones were cared for by the Dragon of Compassion."]}] 1
