I, Finn, the village librarian, adjust my spectacles and settle into my favorite armchair. Outside, children chase fireflies, their laughter echoing through the air.","It\'s a peaceful scene, one I cherish. But tonight, a different story stirs within me. A tale not for bedtime whispers, but for those with brave hearts and curious minds. It\'s the legend of the Ancient City.","The elders say the city lies buried deep beneath the earth, shrouded in eternal darkness.  Some believe it was built by a race long gone, vanished like smoke in the wind. Others whisper of a terrible curse, one that turned its inhabitants into monstrous creatures.",["Whatever the truth, the Ancient City holds a chilling allure.","\nLegends speak of towering structures, crafted from a strange, shimmering rock.  Whispers tell of vast libraries filled with knowledge older than time itself."],"But the greatest treasure, some say, lies within the heart of the city: a pulsating core, rumored to hold unimaginable power.","Many a brave soul has ventured into the depths seeking this fabled treasure. But none have ever returned. The darkness, they say, is a living entity, swallowing light and hope alike.  Sinister whispers echo through the tunnels, preying on fear. And the Wardens…","oh, the Wardens! These blind guardians of the city are said to be monstrous beings, their senses attuned to the faintest vibration.  A single misplaced step, a stifled cough, and they descend upon the intruder with an ungodly fury.","The villagers fear these stories, and rightly so.  The entrance to the Ancient City lies hidden somewhere within the Deep Dark, a treacherous biome crawling with hostile creatures.  Even the bravest adventurer shivers at the thought of venturing there.","But me, Finn the librarian? I find myself strangely drawn to this legend.  The knowledge, the forgotten secrets… it all begs to be uncovered.  Perhaps one day, when my beard is a little whiter and my bones a little creakier, ","I\'ll gather the courage to delve into the darkness. Until then, I keep this story alive, sharing it with curious ears under the watchful gaze of the setting sun. For even if the city itself remains lost, the legend reminds us – there\'s always more to discover in this vast world,",["even beneath our very feet.  Just be sure to tread carefully, friend.","\nThe darkness holds secrets, but it also holds danger."]]}] 1
