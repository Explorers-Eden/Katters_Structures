I rise from my hay bed, careful not to disturb Agnes, the grumpy baker who shares our humble abode. A quick breakfast of bread and beetroot stew – Agnes isn\'t the most creative cook – and I\'m off to my beloved library.","bold":false}]','"The smell of old paper and ink calms me. I straighten the shelves, each book like a familiar friend. Today, young Timmy, all knees and elbows, bursts in. He wants a book on \'becoming a hero.\' I point him towards the taming section – a good hero needs a loyal wolf by their side, after all."','"Later, Beatrice the farmer arrives, flustered. Seems a pesky creeper blew up half her wheat farm. I hand her a well-worn copy of \'Essential Explosives Safety.\' Beatrice raises an eyebrow, but I know she\'ll appreciate the diagrams."','"As the sun dips low, I head home, my heart full. Being a librarian isn\'t glamorous, but knowledge is power, and power protects our village."','[{"text":"Day 7","bold":true},{"text":"\\nUnease hangs heavy in the air. A low growl echoes from the distant forest. We haven\'t had a pillager raid in years, but whispers turn to worried shouts. I nail a sign to the library door: \\"Closed Until Further Notice.\\" Knowledge can\'t fight pillagers, but it can wait.","bold":false}]','[{"text":"Day 10","bold":true},{"text":"\\nThe raid came and went like a desert storm. Thankfully, Harold the Fletcher had enough arrows for everyone, and Gregory the Blacksmith\'s new iron golems did wonders. We lost a few chickens, but everyone\'s safe.","bold":false}]','[{"text":"Day 14","bold":true},{"text":"\\nRelief gives way to rebuilding. I help Agnes clear debris from her bakery, then head to the library, heart sinking. Smoke curls from the broken window. Inside, charred books litter the floor, the smell of ash stinging my nose. Tears prick my eyes. These weren\'t just books, they were our history, our stories.","bold":false}]','[{"text":"Day 15","bold":true},{"text":"\\nThe village gathers around the smoldering library. Despair hangs heavy, but then, a small hand tugs at my sleeve. It\'s Timmy, clutching a singed book. \'We can fix them,\' he declares, his eyes bright. \'We just need paper and ink!\'","bold":false}]','"A spark ignites within me. We may have lost some stories, but the love of learning remains. Together, we\'ll rebuild, page by precious page."','[{"text":"Day 21","bold":true},{"text":"\\nThe library may be a work in progress, but it\'s open again. The shelves hold a mix of salvaged books and new ones, donated by villagers who rummaged through their attics. Timmy sits by the window, copying a page from a damaged book with careful strokes.","bold":false}]','"As I watch him, I realize something beautiful. Even after a raid, even with a half-burnt library, the spirit of our village, the thirst for knowledge, remains unbroken. And that, I know, is a story worth protecting."']}] 1
