Gather \'round and lend an ear to the tale of Bartholomew the Librarian, and the most peculiar sheep this village has ever seen. Now, me, I\'ve been behind this lectern for more moons than I can count. Seen countless trades, barters gone wrong with pillagers,"','"even the occasional hero stoppin\' by for a good ol\' enchanted sword. But nothin\' coulda prepared me for the day Humphrey the Shepherd came bustin\' through the library doors, eyes wide as melons."','["\'Bartholomew!\' he hollered, voice shakin\' like a leaf in a storm. \'Bartholomew, you gotta come see this!\'","\\nNow, Humphrey\'s a good lad, dependable as the sunrise. But him panickin\'? That was rarer than a diamond pickaxe."]','"Curiosity gnawed at me somethin\' fierce, so I shut the book I was readin\' – somethin\' about the history of redstone, fascinating stuff – and followed Humphrey out into the crisp mornin\' air."','"We hurried past the blacksmith\'s clangin\' hammer, past the baker\'s sweet-smelling stall, until we reached the grassy plains beyond the village walls. There, amongst the usual flock of white as snow sheep, stood one... different."','"Its wool wasn\'t the usual snowy white, mind you. No, this sheep\'s coat was the color of a sunset after a rain shower, a soft, gentle pink that seemed to glow in the mornin\' light. Humphrey gaped at it, then at me, then back at the sheep."','["\'Pink,\' he whispered, like he was afraid to say it too loud. \'A pink sheep!\'","\\nI knelt down, mesmerized.  In all my years, I\'d never seen such a sight. It was like somethin\' out of a dusty fable book, a creature of pure wonder."]','["The other sheep seemed to be starin\' at it too, a mix of confusion and curiosity in their big, black eyes.","\\nWord spread through the village faster than a blaze through dry wood. Soon, everyone was out starin\' at the pink wonder."]','["The children chased it around the field, giggling as its pink wool flopped this way and that. Even Agnes, our grumpy old librarian (bless her soul), cracked a smile.","\\nHumphrey, ever the responsible one, built a little pen to keep the pink sheep safe."]','"We named it Rosie, of course. It became the village mascot, a symbol of good luck and good fortune. We even started dyein\' our wool pink in honor of Rosie, though nothin\' could quite match the natural beauty of her coat."','"Rosie lived a long and happy life, grazin\' in her pen and bringin\' a smile to everyone\'s face. And me? Well, I added a whole new chapter to my history book, a tale of the day the wool turned funny, and the pink sheep that brought a little bit of magic to our village."']}] 1
