One day, a sight that defied belief appeared: a colossal turtle, its shell as vast as a floating island, drifted lazily across the heavens.","The villagers, awestruck, watched in wonder as the celestial creature passed overhead.","Inspired by this extraordinary sight, a group of intrepid villagers decided to build a new home, a settlement nestled beneath the protective shell of the sky turtle.","They sailed the seas, guided by the stars and the turtle\'s gentle passage, until they found the perfect spot.","With hammers and saws in hand, they began to construct their village, a testament to their ingenuity and their unwavering faith in the turtle\'s benevolence.","As their village grew, so too did their reverence for the celestial creature. They believed it was a sign of divine favor, a protector against the storms and the trials of life.","They named it the Skyrtle, a fitting title for such a magnificent being.","But their peaceful existence was soon to be shattered. A figure descended from the heavens, a being of ethereal beauty and immense power. The villagers, mistaking him for a benevolent spirit, welcomed him with open arms. ","They offered him gifts and shared their stories, hoping to forge a bond with this celestial visitor.","However, their hopes were dashed. The visitor, known as Tenkū Mizu Gami, the Guardian of the Sky Turtle, was not there to make friends. He was there to protect his sacred charge from the encroachment of mortal hands.","Enraged by the desecration of his domain, he unleashed a torrent of celestial fury upon the village. The once peaceful settlement was reduced to rubble, its inhabitants scattered and wounded.","The villagers, traumatized by the attack, fled the island, leaving behind the remnants of their dreams. The once idyllic haven had become a place of fear and despair. The Sky Turtle, once a symbol of hope, now carried the weight of a tragic past.","Weeks later, a small group of brave souls returned to the island, hoping to salvage what remained. But they were met with a renewed wave of destruction.","Tenkū Mizu Gami, ever vigilant, attacked the intruders, forcing them to retreat. The incident further solidified the villagers\' fear of the Sky Turtle, a fear that would linger for generations to come."]}] 1
