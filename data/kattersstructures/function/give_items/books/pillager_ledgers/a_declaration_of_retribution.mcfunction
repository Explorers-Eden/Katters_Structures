My patience, a virtue you once feigned to commend, has reached its absolute terminus.",{"text":"It has come to my undeniable attention that the attempts upon my life, thinly veiled as unfortunate \"accidents,\" were in fact calculated assassinations, meticulously orchestrated from within your own ranks."},"Do you presume me so naive as to believe a Ravager's sudden frenzy, a magical conduit's inexplicable surge, or a Golem's anomalous malfunction to be mere coincidence?","My mastery of these forces grants me an insight far beyond your crude deceptions. I have uncovered the insidious threads of manipulation, not of my magic itself, but of the very circumstances intended to precipitate my demise.","Furthermore, my investigations have unveiled a cabal of your highest-ranking officials, individuals who once postured as paragons of illager fortitude, attempting to subvert my power for their own nefarious ends.","These are not the actions of isolated dissenters, but the orchestrated malice of a concerted effort. And the orchestrator, the mind pulling these strings from the shadows, is patently obvious.","This is an attack, direct and undeniable, sanctioned by you, Rústa. Your public decree of exile, once presented as a measure of protection, now reveals itself as a transparent pretense, a cynical maneuver to justify my removal.","Consider this my formal renunciation of all former ties. You sought to eliminate me through deceit; you shall now face the consequences of direct confrontation. Be advised: My tower is now a fortress of retribution.","Any illager, regardless of rank or former affiliation, who approaches with hostile intent, who seeks to breach my defenses or infringe upon my domain, will be met with the full, unreserved force of my power.","I will not hesitate. I will not hold back. Every intrusion will be answered with overwhelming reprisal.",{"text":"And let this also be unequivocally understood: I will no longer tolerate the patronizing appellation of \"Nice Theron.\" That moniker, a testament to your incomprehension and my forbearance, is now an insult."},{"text":"My actions from this moment forward shall be anything but \"nice.\""},"As a testament to the gravity of this declaration, and as irrefutable proof of my findings, I enclose two grim tokens.",{"text":"These are the heads of Elder Vark and Krag the Unyielding, retrieved from within a village, where they clearly had no legitimate business, and whose presence at a clandestine meeting concerning my \"disposal\" was confirmed."},"Let their faces serve as a stark warning: I know your schemes, and I know your collaborators.","The war you have tacitly declared upon me, old father, is now explicit. Prepare for its consequences.",{"text":"\n\nTheron, Master of the Arcane."}]}] 1
