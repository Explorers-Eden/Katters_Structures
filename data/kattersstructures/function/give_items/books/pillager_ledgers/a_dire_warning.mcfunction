He doth speak of \"persuasion\" and \"unlikely alliances\" with creatures that our forebears would have crushed beneath heel, not parleyed with. "},"He hath even convinced those accursed witches, those cackling aberrations, to aid our cause! This is not strategy, Rústa, but a betrayal of every principle upon which our strength was forged.","Where is the satisfying crunch of bone beneath boot? Where is the glorious roar of a charge met with unwavering might?","Theron replaces these true methods with shimmering lights and whispered words, with illusions that deceive rather than power that dominates.",{"text":"He is called \"Nice Theron\" by the common illager, a moniker that curdles the blood of any who remember the proud, fearsome legacy we once held."},"Our very essence, our reputation for uncompromising force, is being chipped away, replaced by the effeminate arts of the sorcerer.","And now, even thou, my Chieftain, Rústa of the fearsome name, hast begun to dabble in these arcane practices.","Thou, whose might once inspired terror across these lands, art seen muttering incantations, tracing symbols like some frail bookworm!","This is an insult to thy own formidable power, a concession to the very weakness we have always disdained. It pains me beyond words to witness this slow erosion of the true illager spirit.","Therefore, with all the loyalty and conviction of a lifetime of shared conquest, I must lay before thee a dire ultimatum.","The path Theron walks is one that leads to the utter dissolution of our way of life, a surrender to softness and artifice. ","We, the few remaining who cling to the ancient, unyielding power of the illager, cannot, and will not, follow him down this road.","Let Theron be exiled from our lands. Let him take his peculiar magic and his unsettling friendships elsewhere, to lands where such weakness might be tolerated.",{"text":"Let him seek out his \"unlikely alliances\" far from the purity of our strongholds."},"Should this not come to pass, should Theron's corrupting influence continue to fester within our ranks, then know this: I, Grimgar Stone-Hand, and all those who still believe in the old ways of iron and blood, shall have no choice but to depart from thy company.","We shall form our own legion, one that shall never bow to conjured phantoms or negotiated truces, one that shall reclaim the true, brutal glory of the illager.","The choice is now thine, Chieftain. Preserve the lineage, or preserve the very soul of our people.",["Thy loyal, albeit heartbroken, comrade,",{"text":"\n\nGrimgar Stone-Hand."}]]}] 1
