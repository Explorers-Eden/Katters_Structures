I have observed thy mastery, thy uncanny knack for bending the very fabric of existence to thy will, ","and I see in thee a future that transcends the limited vision of those who cling to rusted iron and brute force alone.",{"text":"Thy methods, tho unconventional to their simple minds, have yielded undeniable results. The very notion of \"Nice Theron\" is a testament to thy subtle power, a power they fear because they cannot grasp it."},{"text":"The truth, which cannot be uttered openly, is this: Thy continued presence amongst the traditionalists, those who cling blindly to the \"old ways,\" hath become a grave risk to thy very being."},"Their fear of what they do not understand, their stubborn adherence to a past that cannot forever define our future, would inevitably lead to conflict. They perceive thy magic not as an evolution, but as a corruption, a weakness that must be purged.",{"text":"I have seen the glint in their eyes, heard the whispers of their discontent, and I know their hearts. They would seek to \"re-correct\" thy path, perhaps even to extinguish thy light, believing it to be for the good of the illager kind."},{"text":"Therefore, this \"exile\" is not a banishment born of my displeasure, but a strategic removal for thy own preservation. Go forth, my son, with thy tower and thy peculiar allies, and continue to hone thy formidable gifts."},"Explore the depths of thy power, unhindered by the narrow-mindedness of those who cannot see beyond the swing of an axe. Establish thy influence in lands where thy unique talents can flourish without the constant threat of internal strife.","This separation, tho it pains me to enforce, is intended to allow thee to grow unmolested, to become the formidable force I know thou art destined to be.","When the time is right, and when the lesser minds have perhaps come to understand the true nature of power, or when their resistance hath been sufficiently… addressed, then shall our paths converge once more.","Until then, know that thy father, tho he must publicly speak of exile, holds thee in highest regard and watches thy progress with keen interest. Do not falter. Continue to demonstrate the undeniable efficacy of thy methods.","May thy magic ever serve thee well, and may thy path be clear of those who would seek to dim thy light.",["With a heavy heart, yet with unwavering belief,",{"text":"\n\nRústa, Chieftain of the Ravaged Lands."}]]}] 1
