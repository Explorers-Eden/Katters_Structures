","This mineral, a resource that would be put to far better use in the forging of our own armaments, is instead squandered upon the construction of their most fearsome and most tiresome guardians: the iron golems.","These lumbering beasts, forged from the very ground upon which the city stands, are a relentless and unthinking defense. ","They do not tire, they do not feel pain, and they appear in numbers that defy all logic, seeming to rise from the very cobblestones to repel our every assault.","One hath planned every manner of raid, from the most direct assault to the most subtle infiltration, yet all have foundered upon this unyielding tide of iron. ","It is not an honorable defeat, but a frustrating one, a conflict against a foe that acts with no thought, only brute and unbreakable purpose.","It is as if the very city itself, drawing strength from the rich vein upon which it rests, has decided that it simply will not be conquered. It is a refusal that one finds most disrespectful.","Thus, Skyhold remains, a stain upon the land and a monument to a stubbornness that is as unyielding as the iron that forms its heart.","It is a city that cries out to be taken, a prize that one can almost taste, yet it refuses to yield to the inevitable. A most irritating state of affairs, indeed."]}] 1
