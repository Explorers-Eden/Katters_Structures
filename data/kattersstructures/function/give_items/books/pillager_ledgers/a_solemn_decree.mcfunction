","The whispers, tho not always spoken aloud, have reached my ears, echoing the growing apprehension felt by the vast majority of our warriors and elders.","The very spirit of the illager, honed by generations of honest conquest and unyielding might, is perceived to be in peril.","It is clear, with a clarity that pains me to acknowledge, that the path chosen by my son, Theron, despite its occasional, unconventional successes, hath created a rift, threatening to cleave our proud lineage asunder.",{"text":"His \"magic ways,\" his perplexing reliance on subtle arts and unnatural alliances – particularly with those odious witches – have sown seeds of doubt and weakness where only strength should flourish."},"This is not the way of the illager, and the risks of his continued presence among us have become too great to bear.","Consider, my loyal brethren, the dangers that confront us if this course be maintained:",[{"text":"The Softening of Our Resolve:","bold":true},{"text":"\nShould we continue to embrace such ethereal and indirect methods, our warriors shall lose their edge, their thirst for true, brutal conflict dulled by a reliance on conjured illusions and spectral trickery.","bold":false}],"Our very name, once synonymous with terror and overwhelming force, shall become a whisper of sorcery rather than a roar of might.",[{"text":"The Corruption of Our Bloodline:","bold":true},{"text":"\nThis dalliance with arcane powers risks tainting the pure, martial essence of the illager. Our future generations might forget the simple, undeniable truth of steel and strength,","bold":false}],"seeking power in shadows and incantations rather than in disciplined training and righteous fury.",[{"text":"The Loss of Trust and Unity:","bold":true},{"text":"\nThe schism is already upon us. Brave and true illagers, those who still cling to the honored traditions of our ancestors, stand ready to depart, their loyalty to the old ways outweighing even their loyalty to their Chieftain. ","bold":false}],"This division, if unaddressed, would weaken us beyond measure, making us vulnerable to even the meanest of foes.","Therefore, with the gravest sorrow, yet with the unwavering conviction that this is the only path to preserve the very soul of the illager kind, I hereby declare this:",{"text":"Theron, my son, is to be exiled from the Ravaged Lands.","bold":true,"italic":true},"He shall depart these territories, taking his magic and his peculiar alliances elsewhere. Let him find a new purpose, far from the sacred traditions he hath, perhaps unwittingly, threatened to undermine.","This painful choice is made not out of malice, but out of a desperate need to unite our fractured spirit and to reaffirm our commitment to the strength and ferocity that hath ever defined us. ","May his departure serve as a reminder that the true power of the illager lies not in fleeting spells, but in the unwavering might of our arms, the cunning of our strategies, and the unbroken unity of our brethren.","Let the old ways be restored, and let our strength shine forth unblemished once more.",["By my hand, and by the ancient laws of our people,",{"text":"\n\nRústa, Chieftain of the Ravaged Lands."}]]}] 1
