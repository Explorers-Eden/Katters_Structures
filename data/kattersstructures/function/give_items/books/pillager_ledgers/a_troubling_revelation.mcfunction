A painful, yet necessary, act, or so we believed.","However, the Chieftain, in his usual convoluted manner, entrusted me with a sealed missive to be delivered to Theron himself, one to be given only upon his departure from our lands.","My instructions were clear, yet my loyalty to thee and to the true path compelled a most difficult choice. Knowing the depth of our convictions, and fearing some hidden machination, I broke the seal and read its contents.","And what I found within, Grimgar, hath shaken my very understanding of the Chieftain’s intent. The letter, penned in Rústa’s own hand, spoke not of Theron’s dangerous influence or the weakening of our spirit, but of a profound and unwavering trust in his son’s abilities.","It spoke of how Theron's unique gifts were too potent, too risky to remain amidst the traditionalists, hinting at dangers from within our own ranks that his presence might incite.",{"text":"It even suggested that this \"exile\" was a shield, a means to protect Theron himself from those who might oppose his path with violent intent, rather than a genuine repudiation of his magic."},"The Chieftain expressed a deep concern for Theron's well-being, stating that this forced separation was a necessary measure to ensure his son's survival and future growth.","It seems Rústa, despite his public pronouncements, fears that Theron’s extraordinary power and progressive methods would make him a target among certain elements within our own society – perhaps even among those who hold dear the traditions we both champion.","The letter implied that the Chieftain was forced to make this public show of banishment to appease the growing dissent, all while secretly believing in Theron’s potential and safeguarding him.","Thus, Grimgar, I did not deliver this letter. It remains concealed, its true contents known only to myself, Rústa, and now, to thee.","My mind reels with this revelation. Is our Chieftain a deceiver, playing both sides? Or is he a cunning strategist, protecting his heir through a web of calculated deceit?","What course of action should one now pursue? To deliver the letter is to reveal Rústa’s apparent duplicity and potentially embolden Theron.","To withhold it is to maintain the illusion, yet to know that our own Chieftain acts with such cunning. I await thy counsel, for this truth is a heavy burden, and I know not which path serves the true future of the illager.",["Thy perplexed and loyal comrade,",{"text":"\n\nCaravan Clem"}]]}] 1
