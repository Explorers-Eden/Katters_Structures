Nay, the command to build and hold this rock was the singular, ","uncompromising vision of none other than our Chieftain himself, Rústa of the Ravaged Lands.","One recalls with a certain, dry bitterness the day the decree was issued. It was a time of relative… calm, a period of consolidation after a most satisfactory series of raids. ","And yet, the Chieftain, whose mind is ever turning towards future dominion, announced that our efforts shouldst be diverted towards the sea.",{"text":"We, who are masters of the land, were to become builders of a grand sentinel upon a remote isle, all for the purpose of keeping a \"watch.\" A tedious and seemingly superfluous task, to our practical minds."},"This grand scheme of Rústa’s, tho one would never say so to his face, was a source of some internal grumbling. It was not born of necessity, for there was naught upon the waters to threaten us then.","Rather, it was an act of preemptive foresight, a defensive measure against a hypothetical threat that had yet to manifest. The common illager, preoccupied with the more immediate gratifications of a well-plundered village,","couldst not comprehend the strategic value of such a long-term burden.",{"text":"And yet, in hindsight, one must begrudgingly admit a certain grim brilliance to his command. For it was at this time that Theron, the so-called \"Nice,\" was but a squalling bundle of peculiar energy."},"He was not yet the force of magic we know now, merely a strange babe whose presence made the air itself seem to shift. The schism of our people was naught but a distant shadow, and yet,","our Chieftain, with a wisdom that transcended our own, saw fit to secure our coast before the true troubles began.","The Far Watch Outpost, then, is not merely a tower; it is a tangible monument to Rústa’s chilling foresight. It was his idea, and his alone, born from a mind that perceives threats before they ever dare to materialize.","He was not against its construction, nay, he was the very engine behind it, driving us to toil in a place we had no true desire to be, all for a future that was, at the time, as hazy as the distant shore.","A most unpleasant command, truly, but one that hath proven its regrettable necessity."]}] 1
