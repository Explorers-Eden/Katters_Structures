Theron, by his very existence and through his unparalleled resilience in the face of what others might deem \"accidents,\" proves himself a truly blessed and formidable heir."},{"text":"His magic is not a weakness, but a shield, a weapon, and a testament to his singular destiny. He is indeed \"Nice Theron,\" for he hath made even misfortune serve his purpose."}]}] 1
