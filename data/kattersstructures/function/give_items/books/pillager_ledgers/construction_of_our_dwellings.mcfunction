","It is not as if our building principles are exceedingly complex; nay, merely a matter of applying logic and foresight, qualities regrettably scarce elsewhere.","Our primary material, as any discerning eye can attest, is the venerable dark oak wood. Some might question its sombre hue, tho its inherent strength and resistance to the elements are undeniable.","We cleave it with precision, for wasted material is a lamentable oversight, unlike the wild, unkempt groves favored by others. From this sturdy timber, we fashion not flimsy huts, but stout, unyielding walls, often reinforced with stone for added durability.","One finds it rather irksome, the constant need for maintenance of lesser structures; our own are built to endure, a testament to our efficiency.","The foundational principles of our architecture are rooted in defense and dominance. Our outposts, placed with deliberate intent, are not merely shelters but bastions of control.","They are often raised, sometimes upon pillars of stone, to afford a commanding view of the surrounding lands. This grants us the undeniable advantage of observing the movements of others, tho they, in their blissful ignorance, rarely perceive our watchful gaze.","The very height of our structures is a subtle declaration of our superiority, a fact lost on those who prefer to grovel on the ground.","Within our outposts, the layout is meticulously planned, not for comfort, which is largely superfluous, but for unimpeded movement and strategic advantage.","Corridors are wide enough for the passage of our patrols, and doors are robust, designed to deter unwelcome intrusions rather than invite idle company.","There are dedicated spaces for weapon storage, for the housing of our valuable Ravager companions (who, one must admit, require considerable space), and for the efficient deployment of forces.","Every block serves a purpose, unlike the superfluous adornments one finds in other, less practical, dwellings.","The exterior of our structures, whilst perhaps appearing somewhat spartan to the uninitiated eye, is imbued with a certain imposing aesthetic. ","The sharp angles, the dark materials, and the occasional banner proclaiming our presence serve as a clear warning to any who might consider unwarranted proximity.","It is not our intent to charm, but to intimidate, and in this, our architectural principles are undeniably successful. ","The very sight of an illager outpost often suffices to discourage idle curiosity, a most efficient form of defense, tho some might consider it rather unfriendly.","In essence, our building process is a continuous application of superior engineering and strategic planning. We build not merely to shelter, but to assert, to control, and to stand as a constant reminder of our unwavering presence.","The efforts of others, by contrast, seem haphazard, inefficient, and ultimately, quite temporary. It is a pity, truly, that they lack the foresight to build with such lasting purpose."]}] 1
