The time for whispers is past; the hour for decisive action is upon us.",{"text":"As ye all know, the \"exile\" of Theron was a farce, a deception orchestrated by Rústa himself. The letter, which was intercepted – a small victory in itself, I assure ye – revealed the Chieftain’s true heart."},"He did not cast out his son for fear of our ways being broken, but for fear of Theron’s own peculiar might drawing too much ire from those who still hold true to strength. Rústa hath become a serpent, speaking with forked tongue, ","publicly condemning magic whilst privately nurturing its very source within his own bloodline.","He seeks to play both sides, to maintain his grip on power whilst watching our traditions wither. This is unacceptable.",["Elder Vark:",{"text":"\nIndeed, Grimgar. My old eyes have seen many seasons, and never have I witnessed such a betrayal of our core tenets. Rústa, once a beacon of ferocity, now dallies with incantations. He hath become weak, swayed by a son who consorts with witches!"}],["Krag the Unyielding:",{"text":"\nMy blade hungers for true battle, not for shadows and whispers. The common illager grows confused, uncertain of our path. They call Theron \"Nice\"! This alone proves his poisonous influence."}],["Grimgar Stone-Hand:",{"text":"\nPrecisely. The spirit of the illager is being extinguished, replaced by a preference for subtlety over supremacy. We cannot allow this to stand. "}],"Theron, for all his undeniable cleverness, is a dangerous deviation. His very existence, and the path Rústa now treads, threaten to erase who we truly are. The only recourse, therefore, is a swift and decisive re-correction.","We shall act. Theron, in his detached tower, believes himself untouchable, protected by his arcane wards and spectral guardians. This arrogance shall be his undoing. ","We have identified several vulnerabilities, even within his supposedly impregnable fortress.",["Krag the Unyielding:",{"text":"\nHow shall it be done? A direct assault?"}],["Grimgar Stone-Hand:",{"text":"\nNay, Krag, not yet. Such would alert Rústa too soon. We shall use cunning, as befits true illagers, tho not the cowardly magic of Theron. We shall make it appear as a grave oversight, a failure of his own making."}],["Consider these plans:",{"text":"\nSabotage of the Arcane Conduits: Theron's tower is powered by complex magical flows."}],"A precise and sudden disruption, perhaps during one of his more ambitious enchantments, could cause a catastrophic arcane overload, appearing as a spectacular, self-inflicted magical explosion. No physical assailant would be needed; his own power would consume him.",[{"text":"A \"Ritual Gone Awry\":"},{"text":"\nTheron is known for his experimental magic. A highly concentrated, volatile reagent, secretly introduced into his private stores, could ignite during one of his rituals, causing a localized,"}],"yet devastating, explosion that would be attributed to his own recklessness.","Once Theron is… removed, the path to reclaiming our destiny becomes clear. Rústa, weakened by the loss of his preferred heir and facing a unified front of true illagers, will be in no position to resist.","He hath shown himself to be indecisive, prone to compromise. He must be removed from leadership for the sake of our very survival.",["Elder Vark:",{"text":"\nRústa is still powerful, Grimgar. Even with Theron gone, his personal might is considerable."}],["Grimgar Stone-Hand:",{"text":"\nHis personal might is nothing without the loyalty of his warriors, and that, brethren, is what we shall reclaim. With Theron gone, the common illager will see the undeniable truth of the old ways."}],"We shall present them with a clear choice: follow a weak, compromised Chieftain, or rally behind those who will restore our strength and honor.","We shall call for a challenge, a declaration of his unfit leadership, and the majority, disillusioned by his deception, will flock to our banner.","This is not rebellion for rebellion's sake, but a necessary act of preservation. We are the last bastion of true illager strength.","We shall cleanse this corruption, eliminate the source of this weakness, and guide our people back to their rightful, formidable path. Let us prepare. The future of the illagers depends on our unwavering resolve."]}] 1
