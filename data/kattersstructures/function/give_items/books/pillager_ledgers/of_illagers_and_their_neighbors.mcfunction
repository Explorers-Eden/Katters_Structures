One is forced to wonder at their lack of self-preservation, their apparent inability to discern a clear and present… opportunity for change.","We, of course, have no inherent malice, merely a desire for order and, perhaps, a more efficient distribution of… resources. Their continued existence, whilst admirable in its persistence, does present a logistical challenge that one is compelled to address.","It is not as if their homes possess any inherent architectural merit that would warrant their continued occupation. Indeed, the very thought of their rudimentary constructions standing whilst more… advanced designs could be implemented,",["is quite frankly, an affront to good taste.",{"text":"\nOne must, at times, gently remind them of the transient nature of all things, particularly their villages."}]]}] 1
