One might, perchance, be tempted to question why we, masters of the vast and proper land, shouldst bother with such a lonely rock.","Such a query, however, doth betray a lack of vision most profound. This outpost, a fine piece of illager craftsmanship, was not for ease, but for a purpose most necessary and, alas, most tiresome.","The building of it was a testament to our resolve, for every axe, every board of dark wood, and every stone had to be carried across a great and turbulent stretch of ocean. ","The island itself, a wind-swept and ungenerous piece of land, gave us naught but rock to stand upon. One's patience was sorely tried by the unceasing journeying over the waters, yet we endured, for the reward was of some consequence.","From the high point, a mighty tower riseth, and from its peak, one may gaze upon all the surrounding waters, a most invaluable vantage point, tho it doth make one's eyes ache with the sheer breadth of it.","The cause for this undertaking, thou shouldst know, is the most aggravating of the villagers' recent follies. They, in their utter lack of wit, hath seen fit to build a hovel-village upon the very edge of the sea,",{"text":"a collection of pathetic wooden huts that they audaciously deem a \"harbor.\""},"This wretched collection, tho it be small and frail, couldst become a foothold from which their annoying kind might spread their blight of farming and unceasing chatter.","Henceforth, the Far Watch Outpost was raised, a most dire and necessary response to their foolhardy ambition. It standeth as a looming threat, a silent reminder of our constant watch.","From its grand height, our sentinels canst espy every fishing boat that dares to venture forth from their so-called port. We doth track their pathetic wanderings and, ","shouldst the need arise, offer a most decisive lesson in our presence with a well-aimed volley or a swift raid. It is a vital service we offer them, tho they, in their blissful ignorance, see it as but a most unfriendly gesture.","Alas, the outpost is a burden. The winds howl, the salt spray doth sting, and there is little here that is of interest save the endless, unblinking sea.","Yet one must endure, for it is a most critical place. Forsooth, Far Watch is no mere watchtower; it is a declaration that the sea, as the land, ","is a domain where every movement is marked and every act of defiance shall be met with our most careful and critical review."]}] 1
