We are masters of the forest, the mountain, and the village path. Yet, Rústa’s foresight hath condemned us to become… mariners, a most ignoble trade.","The sea, unlike the reliable ground beneath our boots, is a fickle and unpredictable mistress. One moment it is calm, and the next, it doth rise up in fury, tossing our crude vessels with a contemptuous rage.","One finds it rather irksome, this constant struggle against a foe that hath no mind, only a relentless and frustrating force.","The transport of goods is a matter of profound difficulty. Our crafts, fashioned from a material that regrettably floats, are cumbersome and sluggish. Weapons, which ought to be kept dry and sharp, are exposed to a dampness that doth dull their edge. ","Provisions, painstakingly gathered from the proper, land-based villages, are too often lost to the deep, slipping from a rope or being soaked beyond all use.","And worst of all, our own brethren, loyal and fierce on land, are rendered helpless by the rocking motion, and are, alas, occasionally swallowed by the unforgiving waves.","All for the sake of supplying a rock that could have been just as well watched from a land-based tower.","Alas, one endures this folly. The resources and manpower consumed by this tedious process could be far better utilized elsewhere—in a proper, glorious assault upon a well-fortified city, ","or in the subjugation of those who have yet to recognize our supreme authority.","Yet, we are told that this hardship is for the future. One must simply hope that the future doth not involve more such ill-conceived journeys. For what good is a master of the land when he is at the mercy of the waves?"]}] 1
