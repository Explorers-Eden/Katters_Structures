","To seek their aid was, to many, an act of desperation, a surrender to the very forces of chaos and unreliability.","Yet, Theron, with his unsettling blend of arcane power and unsettlingly calm demeanor, saw not an enemy to be crushed, but a… resource to be exploited.","The tale of their persuasion is not one of force, as any true illager would have preferred, but of subtle manipulation and, dare one say, a shared understanding of certain… interests.","It is rumored, tho not openly confirmed by any of the more senior illagers, that Theron did not simply demand their fealty.","Nay, he engaged in prolonged parleys, exchanging not threats, but secrets, and, most disturbingly, offering benefits.",{"text":"He spoke of shared grievances against the \"order\" of the overworld, of the mutual convenience of disrupting established norms, and, perhaps most persuasively, of opportunities for acquiring rare ingredients and expanding their own dark knowledge,"},["opportunities that only a well-organized illager presence could provide.",{"text":"\nIt is said he offered them access to hitherto unplundered mushroom fields, untouched forests teeming with peculiar fungi, "}],["and even the promise of certain... experimental subjects from newly subdued villages.",{"text":"\nThe precise terms remain shrouded in the kind of arcane secrecy that only Theron and his new, peculiar allies seem to comprehend."}],"But the outcome is undeniable: the witches, those solitary, unpredictable creatures, now occasionally lend their assistance to our expeditions, their potions causing chaotic confusion amongst our foes, their curses weakening defenses, ",["and their strange magics sowing discord where our own blades might have simply found iron.",{"text":"\nTho the sight of a witch aiding an illager fills some of the more traditional amongst us with a profound sense of unease, "}],["and their cackles still grate upon the nerves, one cannot deny the effectiveness of this most unlikely alliance.",{"text":"\nIt is not the illager way, some grumble, to engage in such… negotiations."}],"But Theron, with his unsettling genius, hath proven that even the most despised of creatures can be bent to our will, albeit through means that remain, to our practical minds, entirely too… civilized.","The results, however, are difficult to dispute, even if they leave a bitter taste in the mouth."]}] 1
