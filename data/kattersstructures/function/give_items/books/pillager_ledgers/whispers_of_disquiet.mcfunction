Where once a proud illager would meet an enemy with a roar and a crushing blow, now they speak of \"vexes\" and \"evocations,\" like some common witch of the woods."},"And now, the unthinkable doth occur: Chieftain Rústa himself, whose very name once inspired fear through sheer force of will, hath been observed attempting to ape his son’s peculiar habits. ","He fumbles with gnarled staves, muttering foreign words, his powerful hand, which once wielded the heaviest axe, now tracing symbols in the air. This is a profound betrayal of the old traditions, a forfeiture of true strength for ephemeral sparks.","The very soul of the illager, honed through generations of conquest by honest, brutal force, is at stake.","Therefore, it is resolved amongst us, a loyal few who still cherish the purity of our heritage, that this… deviation cannot be allowed to fester.","The lineage must be preserved, the path of the true illager re-established. Theron, for all his undeniable cleverness, represents a dangerous future, a dilution of all we stand for.","His removal, therefore, becomes a regrettable, tho utterly necessary, act of preservation.",{"text":"Considerations for such an unfortunate \"accident\" have been deliberated with the utmost care, to ensure no suspicion falls upon those who act with the purest intentions:"},[{"text":"A \"Mishap\" with a Ravager:","bold":true},{"text":"\nTheron, in his youthful overconfidence, might be persuaded to attempt a new \"bonding technique\" with a particularly spirited beast during a training exercise, leading to a most regrettable mauling.

The future of our people depends upon it."]}] 1
