Where once was barrenness, green shoots emerged, nourished by a secret dew.","The creatures, too, felt a shift in their hearts; the pillager’s greed waned, the zombie’s hunger dulled, and the drowned found solace in the depths.","It was said that these were signs of Jean\'s grace, miracles wrought by her spirit, even in her transformed state. For in the heart of every creature, a spark of hope ignited.","There was a farmer, old and weary, whose fields had yielded naught for seasons. In despair, he knelt, his voice a whisper carried by the wind. And lo, in the morning, his fields were lush, teeming with life.","The people hailed it a miracle of Jean, a testament to her enduring love for all living things.","And there was a child, lost and alone in the darkening woods. Fear gnawed at her heart, and shadows seemed to close in. But then, a soft glow appeared, a guiding star in the twilight. The child followed its light, and emerged into a clearing bathed in moonlight.","There, a creature of shadow and flame watched over her, its eyes filled with a gentle understanding. The child was unharmed, and from that day forward, she spoke of the Dragon\'s kindness, a protector of the lost and vulnerable.","These and countless other miracles were attributed to Jean, her spirit woven into the fabric of the world. And so, the people prayed to her, seeking solace, guidance, and protection.","For in the heart of the Dragon, they believed, resided the soul of a maiden, a symbol of hope and redemption."]}] 1
