A blight crept across the land, withering crops and poisoning the waters.","Despair gnawed at the hearts of the people, for their sustenance was threatened.","In their plight, they turned their eyes to the heavens, calling upon Jean, the Dragon of Compassion. And lo, she answered their plea. She descended from the heights, her form a tempest of shadow and light.","With a breath of pure essence, she cleansed the land, dispelling the blight and restoring vitality.","Where once was barrenness, life sprung forth anew. The crops grew bountiful, the waters ran clear, and the creatures rejoiced. And so, the people celebrated a feast in honor of Jean, a testament to her enduring love and her role as protector and provider.","From that day forward, a ritual was established, a time of thanksgiving and renewal. And it was said that as long as the people honored Jean\'s sacrifice and lived in harmony with the land, prosperity would endure."]}] 1
