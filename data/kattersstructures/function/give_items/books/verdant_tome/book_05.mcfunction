The pillagers grew bold, the zombies more aggressive, and even the once peaceful villagers turned on one another.","In this time of strife, the people remembered the teachings of Jean, the Dragon of Compassion. They sought solace in her wisdom, and through meditation and prayer, they found a renewed sense of unity.","It was then that a vision came to the elders of the village. In it, they saw Jeanne, her form bathed in a celestial light. She spoke of the importance of harmony and the dangers of division.","And she revealed a sacred ritual, a gathering of all creatures to share their fears and hopes.","With renewed purpose, the villagers organized the gathering. Creatures from every corner of the land came together, their differences laid aside. Through shared stories and open hearts, they began to understand one another.","The pillagers spoke of their hunger for survival, the zombies of their endless longing, and the villagers of their desire for peace.","As the day drew to a close, a sense of unity washed over the gathering. The fear and mistrust that had divided them began to fade, replaced by empathy and compassion. And as they looked to the heavens, they saw the Dragon, a symbol of hope and unity, watching over them.","From that day forward, the creatures of the land lived in harmony, their differences a source of strength rather than division. And they honored Jean, the Dragon of Compassion, as the mother of their newfound unity."]}] 1
