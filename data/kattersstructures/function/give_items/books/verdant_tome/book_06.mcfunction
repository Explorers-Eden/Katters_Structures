They sought to bind the Dragon, to harness its power for their own ends. But in their hubris, they overlooked the wisdom of the ages.","For when they approached the Dragon\'s lair, they were met not with fire and fury, but with a mournful silence. The Dragon, sensing their intentions, withdrew into the heart of the End, a place of shadows and echoes.","And so, the land fell into disarray. Without the Dragon\'s watchful eye, the balance of nature was disrupted. The once bountiful lands grew barren, and the creatures began to suffer.","In their despair, the people turned to their ancient texts, seeking guidance. And there, in the pages of the Verdant Tome, they found the truth. They realized the folly of their ways and repented of their arrogance.","With renewed humility, they sought to mend their ways. They planted trees, purified the waters, and treated all creatures with respect. And as they did so, a faint echo of the Dragon\'s song reached their hearts, a whisper of hope.","It is said that in time, when the world is healed and the people have learned their lesson, the Dragon will return, not as a conqueror, but as a friend and guardian. Until then, the people strive to live in harmony with the land, honoring the memory of Jean and the wisdom of the ages."]}] 1
