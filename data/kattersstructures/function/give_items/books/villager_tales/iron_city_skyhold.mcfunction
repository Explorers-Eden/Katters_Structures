Apparently, it's made entirely of iron.  Like, the whole place.  Walls, houses, even the… ground?  I guess it's ground.  If it's metal.","Anyway, this trader – let's call him… uh… Barry.  Yeah, Barry.  Barry went there to trade melons.  Melons!  Can you imagine?  Apparently, they have a lot of iron there.  Which makes sense, because it's called Iron City.","Barry had to wait in line.  A long line.  Six people, maybe?  Or was it sixteen?  My cousin's friend's brother's milk delivery guy wasn't clear on the exact number.  But it was a lot.  While he was waiting, he overheard some stuff.","Something about a 'vein' and 'golems.'  Apparently, the golems are huge.  Like, really huge.  One of them, maybe, carried a house made of iron.  Or maybe it was a cart.  Something big.","When Barry finally got in, it was all… iron.  Everywhere.  He got lost, apparently.  Kept bumping into villagers.  They were all busy doing… iron stuff.  Carrying iron, wearing iron, probably even eating iron.  Who knows?","He tried to trade his melons, but it was complicated.  They have signs with… pictures.  And numbers.  It was all very confusing.  Barry couldn't figure it out.  He just wanted to trade his melons!","Barry, or so I'm told, tried another shop.  This villager was talking about… something.  It sounded like… butterflies?  Iron butterflies?  I don't know.  It was something weird.  Barry didn't understand.  He just saw more iron… things.  Shiny things.","Apparently, there are golems everywhere.  Just walking around.  Being golems.  They don't do much, I guess.  Just… exist.  And clang.  They clang a lot.","Someone mentioned a 'Great Forge.'  That's where they make all the iron, I think.  Or maybe they make… other stuff.  Iron stuff.","Barry left.  He couldn't take it anymore.  Too much iron, too many golems, too many confusing signs.  And his melons… well, they were gone.  I think his… llama?  Yeah, llama.  His llama ate them.  Apparently, llamas like melons.","Barry decided he's not going back to Iron City.  Ever.  He's going to trade in a normal village from now on.  One with less iron.  And clearer signs.  And maybe he'll bring carrots next time.  Llamas like carrots, right?","So, yeah, that's the story of Barry and the iron.  Or at least, that's what I heard.  It might not be entirely accurate.  You know how these stories get.  But that's the gist of it.  Iron City, Skyhold. ","Lots of iron.  And golems.  And confusing signs.  And llamas that eat melons.  The end.  Probably."]}] 1
