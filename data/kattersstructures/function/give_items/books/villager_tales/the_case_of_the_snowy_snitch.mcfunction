I, Humphrey the Librarian, adjusted my spectacles and smoothed down my brown robe. Today wasn\'t for browsing books or restocking shelves.","Today, I was a juror – one of twelve villagers tasked with deciding the fate of Norbert the Nitwit. Norbert, a simple soul with perpetually bewildered eyebrows, stood accused of thievery. ","Not just any thievery, mind you, but the unthinkable: stealing presents on Niffler (our Christmas) morning! The audacity of it all! The poor victim, young Timmy the Baker\'s son, still sniffled occasionally, clutching a half-eaten gingerbread man.","The esteemed Judge Grumbles, a formidable iron golem with a permanently furrowed brow, banged his gavel. ‘Alright, settle down, you noisy bunch! We\'re here to hear the case of Norbert the Nitwit, accused of grand Niffler larceny!’","The prosecutor, Beatrice the Blacksmith, a woman whose booming voice could rival a creeper\'s hiss, presented her case. ‘Your honor, the evidence is clear! Timmy awoke to find his Niffler presents, painstakingly crafted by yours truly, missing.","We later found Norbert hiding, shivering like a wet golem, in a house entirely built of snow!’ Beatrice gestured dramatically towards Norbert, who mumbled something about \'pretty snowflakes\' and the \'cold making his nose numb.","A ripple of suspicion ran through the crowd. Building a snow house on Niffler? Suspicious, to say the least. The defense attorney, a nervous young Fletcher named Fletcher, took the stand. ‘Your honor,’ he squeaked, ‘Norbert is a simple soul.","He wouldn\'t know a diamond pickaxe from a wooden hoe! Maybe he just admired the snow house and climbed inside for warmth.’ A snort escaped me. ‘Highly unlikely, Fletcher! Who builds a snow house in the middle of the village square?’","Beatrice seized the opportunity. ‘Exactly! And look at the remaining evidence!’ She pointed towards a trail of muddy footprints leading from Timmy\'s house to the snow structure. The judge leaned forward, his metallic eyes gleaming.","‘Norbert, do you have anything to say for yourself?’ Norbert shuffled his feet, his gaze flickering to the gingerbread man. ‘Uh, well… I did see shiny things in Timmy\'s house. They looked… cold. So I took them to the snow house to keep them warm. But then I got sleepy, and the snow fell, and…’","Beatrice slammed her fist on the table, making Fletcher yelp. ‘Lies! Pure lies! He was caught red-handed, hiding the stolen goods!’ The jury murmured amongst ourselves. The evidence was damning, but something didn\'t sit right with me. Norbert may be a nitwit, but a thief?","Suddenly, a voice piped up from the back. It was Timmy, his watery eyes wide. ‘Actually, Mr. Fletcher is right. I… I forgot to wrap some of my presents. Maybe Norbert just wanted to help wrap them in the snow!’","A collective gasp filled the square. Beatrice sputtered, her face turning as red as a beetroot. Judge Grumbles cleared his throat. ‘Timmy, are you sure?’ Timmy, emboldened, nodded. ‘Yes, Your Honor.","I remember seeing some string and wrapping paper near the snow house too.’ Beatrice slumped in her chair, defeated. Fletcher beamed, his fear replaced by a triumphant grin. The judge boomed, ‘Case dismissed! Norbert, you are hereby declared innocent!’","Relief washed over Norbert, who sheepishly approached Timmy. ‘Sorry about taking your presents, Timmy. Here, have some extra string for your kite!’ Timmy, a smile lighting up his face, accepted the string.","As the crowd dispersed, I approached Norbert. ‘Norbert,’ I said, ‘perhaps next Niffler, you can offer your wrapping skills directly. People might appreciate the help.’ Norbert grinned, a mischievous glint in his eyes.","‘Maybe I will, Mr. Librarian. Maybe I will.’ The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the village. As I walked back to my library, a strange warmth filled my chest.","Niffler may have been a disaster, but sometimes, even the most perplexing situations could end with a happy ending. And sometimes, the best gifts come in unexpected forms, like a nitwit with a knack for wrapping in snow."]}] 1
