He wasn't like the other traders or wanderers who passed through our village.",{"text":"He just appeared one day, talking about a \"catastrophic malfunction\" that had thrown him from the \"timestream.\" He said his \"advanced technology\" was ruined, but we just saw a regular villager with a slightly confused look on his face."},{"text":"He kept going on about something called a \"NeuroSphere\" and being a \"master strategist.\" We just nodded and offered him some carrots."},{"text":"At first, he kept his distance. He’d stand on the hill, watching us build and farm, muttering to himself about \"patterns\" and \"systems.\" We’d see him drawing in the dirt with a stick, making strange diagrams."},{"text":"One day, our elder, Bartholomew, asked him what he was doing. Devin straightened up and declared that he was \"optimizing our infrastructure.\" "},"All he did was suggest we move the community water source a few blocks closer to the wheat fields, a thought we had considered a hundred times before but never bothered with.","But Devin said it with such confidence, with such a grand flourish of his hands, that we humored him and did it. He was so proud.",{"text":"He kept doing things like that. He'd tell Farmer Giles that if he planted his carrots in perfectly straight rows, he would \"maximize his yield per square block.\" Giles just smiled, patted Devin's shoulder, and said it was a good way to keep the lines neat. "},{"text":"Devin would call our simple stone path a \"major transportation artery\" and insist on clearing out all the tall grass, claiming it would \"improve daily life.\" We just thought he was a very tidy man."},{"text":"He'd offer advice on \"defensive fortifications\" by simply suggesting we make our fences two blocks high instead of one to keep out the spiders. He talked about these simple, everyday things as if they were brilliant, strategic breakthroughs."},"We didn't have the heart to tell him we'd all thought of it before.",{"text":"What we didn't expect was how much he would change. He might have thought he was teaching us, but really, he was learning from us. Slowly, his strange, fancy words started to fade. He stopped talking about being a \"strategist.\""},"One evening, as the sun set, we found him sitting by the fire with the younger villagers, just laughing. Not the silent, thoughtful kind of laugh he used to have, but a deep, genuine one that made his shoulders shake.","He started joining us for the community potlucks, sharing tales that, while strange, were always entertaining.","He wasn't a master strategist from a future world. He was just Devin.","We didn't see him as someone with special abilities. We saw him as a new friend who had finally found a place to call home.",{"text":"He came to our village thinking he had all the answers, but he stayed because we gave him the one thing he was missing: a place to belong. We never needed his great \"strategies\" or \"insights.\""},"We just needed a friend to share our simple joy with. And as he finally settled down, no longer muttering about a past he barely remembered, we knew that he had found it, too.","This wasn't a mission for him anymore; it was just life. And he was finally, truly, one of us."]}] 1
