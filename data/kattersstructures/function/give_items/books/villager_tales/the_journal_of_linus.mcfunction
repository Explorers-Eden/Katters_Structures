I left my trousers hanging on the clothesline to dry, the new wool ones I’d traded for just last week."}],"When I went to retrieve them this morning, they were gone. Completely vanished. My first thought was a lone wolf. They’re not uncommon in the woods, and a few have been getting bolder lately, scavenging for scraps.","But the pants? It made no sense. Why would a wolf want my trousers?",["Day 18",{"text":"\n\nThe mystery deepened. My neighbor, Elder Rowan, complained that someone had pilfered a loaf of bread she'd left on her windowsill. We all suspected the same culprits. The bold, scavenging wolves from the Taiga."}],"Rowan insisted she saw a flash of brown fur running into the woods, but she was never quite sure. The villagers are starting to get nervous. Something is amiss.","The usual creatures of the Taiga wouldn't be this brazen.",["Day 20",{"text":"\n\nI saw it. I saw the thief. But it wasn't a wolf at all. I was setting out my rubbish for the day, and as I turned to go inside, I saw a flash of crimson fur dart from behind a spruce tree. It was a fox."}],"A fox with fur as red as a poppy, and it was rummaging through my trash can! I froze, staring in disbelief. It was looking for... something.","I tried to shout, but the words caught in my throat. Just as I was about to call for help, the creature snatched something from the bin and scurried away.","It was my other pair of trousers! The old, patched ones. That little thief had a penchant for my pants. The audacity!",{"text":"I ran to the village square, out of breath and shaking my head in utter confusion. \"It's not a wolf!\" I shouted. \"It's a fox! A red fox! And it's stealing pants!\""},"The villagers just looked at me with blank stares, then looked at the Elder. I know they thought I was crazy. A fox. Stealing pants. Who would believe that?","I started calling him the Arbor Grizzly because he was as brazen as a wild animal, and his fur was the color of autumn leaves in the Arbor. He was a creature of the taiga, yet he acted like a grand, fearsome beast.",["Day 22",{"text":"\n\nI set a trap. A simple one, just a tripwire with a bucket of water. I left a pair of old trousers as bait, just in case he returned."}],"I hid behind the woodpile, waiting. It was hours before he showed up. The crimson fox, The Arbor Grizzly, sniffed the trousers, then the bucket, and then, with a look of what I can only describe as disdain, it nudged the bucket, splashing the water all over the ground.",{"text":"It then picked up the pants, gave me a look that seemed to say, \"Nice try,\" and trotted off into the woods."},"He's not just a fox. He's a cunning, mischievous creature who understands our traps and seems to delight in tormenting us.","He’s not after food. He's after... clothing. I don’t understand.",["Day 25",{"text":"\n\nThe pants are back. I found them folded neatly on my doorstep this morning. They were clean, too. They smelled of moss and forest floor, but they were not dirty. "}],"He took them, washed them, and returned them. Why? The Arbor Grizzly is not a thief; he's a laundry service!","The village is still reeling from this. We don't know what to do. The Arbor Grizzly is not a threat, but he's a constant, bewildering presence. He’s a legend in his own time. ","A cunning fox, a pant-stealing laundry service. The village is now at his mercy, and all he asks for is a good pair of trousers."]}] 1
