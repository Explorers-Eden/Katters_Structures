It wasn\'t a bad name, but some villagers felt it lacked… pizzazz. Old Man Fitzwilliam, bless his heart, started it all. ","He planted a sign in the village square. \'New Name: Eldoria!\' it proclaimed.","The next morning, a new sign appeared next to Fitzwilliam’s. \'Eldoria? Too elven!\' it read, in Butcher Beatrice’s bold scrawl. Then came another: \'How about… Carrotville?\' from Farmer Giles, naturally. ","Librarian Leo countered with \'Bibliopolis,\' while Fletcher Fiona suggested \'Arrow Creek.","The village square, usually a place of calm trading and golem-patrolling, became a chaotic marketplace of ideas. Signs sprouted like weeds. \'Rockham!\' ","\'Sunnyside!\' \'Ironville!\' Every villager had a suggestion, and every suggestion had a counter-suggestion, often scrawled on the back of the original sign, or on a new one placed precariously close.","Discussions raged. \'Carrotville? Are you mad, Giles?\' \'Bibliopolis? Too… bookish!\' \'Arrow Creek? Do we only make arrows?\' The air crackled not with tension, ","but with the scratching of charcoal on wood and the murmur of villagers debating the merits of \'Golemtown\' versus \'Wheatfield.","The iron golem, bless its metallic heart, just tilted its head and occasionally let out a confused clang. Even the nitwit children joined in, scribbling nonsensical symbols and giggling.","The sign proliferation was exponential. They climbed the well, leaned against the houses, and even obscured the golem at one point. The village square was no longer a square, but a labyrinth of wooden pronouncements. ","We villagers could barely move without bumping into a sign advocating for \'Pigtopia\' or \'Crystal Caverns.","The chaos reached its peak when someone suggested \'Signville.\' This sparked a furious debate about the irony of naming a village after its current predicament. ","The signs multiplied, each one arguing for or against \'Signville,\' until the entire village was practically buried under a mountain of wood and charcoal.","We couldn’t see the sky. We couldn’t see each other. We could barely breathe. Florencia, or whatever it was supposed to be called, had become a monument to indecision.","Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the village elder, bless her wise soul, climbed to the top of the sign mountain (with the golem\'s help, of course). She cleared her throat, and her voice echoed through the narrow sign-canyons.",["\'Enough!\' she declared.",{text:"\nSilence fell. Every villager, peeking out from behind their signs, waited with bated breath."}],"\'We have spent days, weeks even, arguing about this,\' the elder continued. \'We have covered our village in signs. We have debated every possible name. And what have we achieved?",["She paused, letting the question hang in the air.",{text:"\n\n\'Nothing,\' she answered herself. \'Absolutely nothing. We are still… Florencia."}],["A collective sigh swept through the village. The elder was right. All that effort, all those signs, and we were right back where we started.",{text:"\nThen, Farmer Giles, ever practical, spoke up. \'Well,\' he said, \'at least we got it out of our systems."}],"And so, we began the long process of removing the signs. It took days. We stacked them, burned some, and repurposed others. Slowly, Florencia emerged from its wooden tomb.","And the name? It stayed Florencia. After all, it wasn\'t so bad. And besides, we were all too tired to think of anything else.","So that\'s the story of the Marker Incident of Florencia. A reminder that sometimes, the best name is the one you already have. And that villagers, given enough charcoal and wood, can create a truly magnificent mess."]}] 1
