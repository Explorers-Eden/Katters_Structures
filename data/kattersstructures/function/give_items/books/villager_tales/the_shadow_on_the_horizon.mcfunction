My boat, \"The Bobbing Buoy,\" cut through the quiet water, leaving a gentle ripple in its wake."},"The sun was just a promise of orange on the eastern sky, and our village, Willow Float, was a huddled mass of scrap wood and woven rope behind me.","The scent of salt and yesterday's fish was a familiar comfort.","I was headed for my favorite fishing grounds, the ones near the great rock we all called the Seamark. It’s always been just that, a stone spire in the middle of the endless sea, a perfect landmark.","But as the sun crested the horizon, it cast a long shadow on the water, and I realized with a jolt that something was wrong. The Seamark's shape had changed.","I rowed closer, my heart thumping against my ribs. The quiet of the morning was shattered by the frantic beat of my own blood in my ears. As I drew nearer, the dark, jagged shape became clear.","It was a tower. A cruel, black spire of wood and stone, rising from the rock. And from its peak, a grim flag whipped in the wind—the pillager banner. My stomach twisted into a knot.","I could see them now, tiny figures moving with purpose on the platform at the base of the tower. Crossbows glinted in the early light. The pillagers had found the Seamark. ",{"text":"They were building a fortress, a \"Far Watch\" as their flag likely named it, and it was pointed right at my home."},"Panic seized me. My hands, calloused and strong from a lifetime of hauling nets, trembled as I spun my boat around. I rowed back to Willow Float with a desperate fury, the image of that dark tower burned into my mind.","I didn’t stop until my boat scraped against the creaking wooden hull of our village.",{"text":"My breathless cry brought the others out of their little shanties. \"Pillagers!\" I yelled, pointing a shaking finger out to sea. \"An outpost! On the Seamark! They're watching us!\""},"They crowded the edge of our village, a silent, fearful mass of villagers, all staring at the dark shape in the distance. The sea had always been our safe haven, a vast expanse that shielded us from the dangers on the land.","But now, that very sea was a highway for our enemies. The endless blue was no longer a comfort. It was a clear, open path from their new fortress directly to our floating home.","Our peace was gone. The calm waves now seemed to whisper a promise of future raids. We could no longer drift peacefully on the currents.","From this day forward, every ripple would feel like a threat, and every passing cloud would cast the shadow of Far Watch upon our little village."]}] 1
