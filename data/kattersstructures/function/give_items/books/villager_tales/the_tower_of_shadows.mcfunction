I speak of the Tower of Shadows, a monument of malice, a blight upon our world.","It was young Barnaby, bless his innocent soul, who first stumbled upon it. He’d wandered too far from the village, chasing a particularly vibrant blue butterfly, as children will do. ","He’d strayed into the deepest part of the Dark Oak, where the trees grow twisted and gnarled, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers.","And there it stood.","A tower of black stone, rising from the gloom like a jagged tooth. It pierced the canopy, its peak lost in the swirling mist that perpetually shrouded it. Barnaby, though but a child, felt a chill deeper than any winter frost.","An aura of dread emanated from the tower, a palpable sense of evil that made his hair stand on end.","He dared not approach.  Even from a distance, he could feel its dark pull, a whisper in his ear promising pain and despair. The air around the tower shimmered with an unnatural energy, and the very ground seemed to recoil from its presence.","And then he saw them.","Pillagers.  They swarmed around the tower like flies around a carcass.  Not just a few scouts, but a whole war party, their banners bearing the mark of the Illager horde. They moved with a purpose, a grim determination that sent shivers down Barnaby’s spine. ","He knew, instinctively, that they served the tower, that they were its guardians.","Barnaby, wise beyond his years, knew he had stumbled upon something terrible. He fled, his little heart pounding like a drum, the image of the black tower burned into his memory. He ran until he burst into the village square, gasping for breath, his eyes wide with terror.","He told us what he had seen.  The tower, black and menacing, shrouded in shadow and guarded by pillagers.  We listened, our faces grim.  For we knew the tales, the whispers of ancient evils that lurked in the forgotten places of the world.","We knew that the Tower of Shadows was no ordinary structure. It was a place of power, a nexus of darkness.","We elders consulted the ancient scrolls, deciphering the cryptic warnings left by our ancestors.  They spoke of a tower built by… something.  Something not of this world.  Something that craved power and sought to corrupt all that is good.","The scrolls warned us: Never approach the tower. Never seek its secrets. Never disturb its slumber.  For within its walls, a great evil lies dormant, waiting for its chance to rise.","So, I tell you now, as a warning and a plea: Stay away from the Dark Oak.  Do not venture into its deepest parts.  And if you see the Tower of Shadows, turn away.  Flee.  Do not look back.","Let the tower remain undisturbed, a monument to the darkness that we must never awaken. Let it stand as a reminder of the evil that lurks in the shadows, waiting for the unwary.","This is my warning. Heed it well, and may the light protect you from the darkness that dwells within the Tower of Shadows.  For some doors are best left unopened, and some secrets are best left buried.","Let this tower be one of them.  For the safety of our village, for the safety of all, never, ever approach the Tower of Shadows."]}] 1
