He was a good child, a kind child, but he had a relentless curiosity that was, to put it mildly, a plague upon the village of Willow Creek.","He didn't ask difficult questions about the meaning of life or the secrets of the Nether. His questions were of a far more mundane, and therefore more infuriating, nature.",{"text":"\"Elder Bartholomew,\" he would ask, his large eyes wide with sincere confusion, \"where do the carrots come from?\""},{"text":"Bartholomew, a patient and wise villager, would sigh. \"Vini, they come from the carrot field.\""},{"text":"\"But how do they come from the carrot field?\""},{"text":"\"We plant them,\" Bartholomew would explain, slowly, as if talking to a particularly dim-witted golem, \"and they grow.\""},{"text":"Vini would furrow his brow. \"But how do they grow?\""},"This line of questioning would often continue until Bartholomew, a man of great patience, would simply make a noncommittal grunting noise and pretend to be asleep.","No one was safe from Vini's inquiries. Butcher Beatrice, a woman of few words and even fewer emotions, was Vini's next target.",{"text":"\"Beatrice,\" Vini would pipe up as she sharpened her cleaver, \"what is that?\""},{"text":"\"It's a cow,\" Beatrice would say, her eyes fixed on her work."},{"text":"\"Why is the cow here?\""},{"text":"\"For meat.\""},{"text":"\"Why do we need meat?\""},{"text":"\"To eat.\""},{"text":"\"Why do we eat meat?\""},"At this point, Beatrice would usually make a low, guttural noise that sounded suspiciously like a growl and stomp away, leaving Vini standing alone, still pondering the deeper philosophical implications of beef.","The children, too, suffered. While they were building a dirt fort, Vini would stand beside them, arms crossed.",{"text":"\"Why are you putting dirt on top of dirt?\" he would ask."},{"text":"\"Why are you using a shovel?\""},{"text":"\"Why is the dirt brown?\""},"They would eventually abandon the fort and run away, leaving Vini alone with his thoughts.","One particularly grueling afternoon, Vini cornered the village librarian, Leo. Leo, a man who cherished quiet and books, was about to sit down with a fresh cup of tea.",{"text":"\"Leo,\" Vini began, \"where do the books come from?\""},{"text":"Leo, already weary from a long day of organizing, said, \"I make them.\""},{"text":"\"But how do you make them?\""},{"text":"\"From paper and ink.\""},{"text":"\"Where do the paper and ink come from?\""},{"text":"\"Paper from sugarcane, ink from squid.\""},{"text":"\"But where do the sugarcane and squid come from?\""},"Leo paused, took a long, deep breath, and without a word, slowly walked over to the bookshelf, placed his tea on a shelf, and began to gently, carefully, place every book in the library on his head. Vini watched, confused.",{"text":"\"Leo,\" he asked, \"why are you putting books on your head?\""},"Leo just stood there, a teetering tower of knowledge on his head, and made a quiet, defeated grunting sound.","The village came to a quiet, unspoken agreement. When Vini approached, they would simply close their eyes, sigh, and pretend to be busy.","They had learned that a quiet grunting noise was the best, and indeed, the only, answer to Vini's endless stream of questions.","He was a puzzle they could not solve, a small, persistent thorn in the side of their peaceful existence. But he was their thorn, and deep down, they knew that a village without Viniâ€™s questions would be a very quiet, very boring place indeed."]}] 1
